# calculator-with-gui
Basic calculator (addition and subtraction) with GUI (java swing)

This is a project that was done through a MOOC course (Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II) by University of Helsinki. 
This specific project (exercise 40.) was a project during week 11 ( https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-11/).

As it is a part of the course, it is validated through TMC which runs the tests online, so my project had to be modified in some parts to accommodate the tests so that I would get points for it.

This is how the project should work:

Create an application to manage people phone numbers and addresses.

The calculator basic functionality is the following. When the user writes a number n into the input field and presses +, the value of the output field is added n and the output field is updated with a new value. Accordingly, when the user writes a number n into the input field and presses -, the value of the output field is decreased by n, and the output field is updated with the new value. If the user presses Z, the output field value is reset to zero.
